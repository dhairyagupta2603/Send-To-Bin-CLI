<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to be a drop-in replacement for the 'rm' command for basic use cases and scenarios. This has some similar functionality to windows recycle bin. This is the first project that I have build in Rust as a exercise to learn and understand its fundamental syntax and package management. 

Regardless, here are some features that make it usefull: -
* It doesn't require any additional configurations for most popular distributions (checked in debian)
* It stores all the "deleted" files in under a folder in home directory until you clear the bin. clearing is also a single intuitive command. 
* Biggest improvemt is the UNDO command which restores the previously deleted files, very useful when you delete your entire project :sunglasses:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

* The system should have a ```.bashrc``` file in the ```$HOME``` directory so that project path and bin path can be specified when installing in linux. 

* The system should also have ```/usr/local/bin``` to write the binary into. If you want to customize the path, you can change the ```$dest``` variable it in the ```linux-install.sh``` file.

### Installation

Installing this project is a very simple process. You just need the following steps: -
1. Clone the repo anyware on your system 
    ```sh
    git clone "https://github.com/dhairyagupta2603/Send-To-Bin-CLI.git"
    ```

2. Run the ```linux-install.sh``` in the root of the project directory
   ```sh
   cd Send-To-Bin-CLI

   sh linux-install.sh
   # or
   bash linux-install.sh 
   # or 
   zsh linux-install.sh
   ```
3. There is no 3rd step. You are done! :star: 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The commands are as follows: -
* Initializing the project is done by 
  ```sh
  stb init
  ```
* 'Deleting' files is as simple as 
  ```sh
  stb file1.txt ../file2.json src/rsc/ 
  ```
* If you want to undo the previous command just do 
  ```sh
  stb undo
  ```
* If you want to clear the bin, you guessed it just
  ```sh
  stb clear
  # or to skip confirmation
  stb clear -y
  ```
* If you don't want to use stb anymore, you can also do 
  ```sh
  stb destroy
  # or if bin is not empty
  stb destroy -f 
  ```
  then remove the projectb path form your ```.bashrc```
